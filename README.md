# simpletextsplitter
An extremely basic tool for splitting txt files into multiple txt files with a certain amount of characters in each file. The number of characters is defined in a constant at the top of the code and can be easily modified. All the code is self contained in one *.cpp* file and can be modified and redestributed in whatever way you see fit.  

Usage
====
The program can be run on Windows or Linux by dragging a txt file onto the executable.
The prebuilt executables are set to seperate the txt file into 200 characters per file.

You can also run it from a terminal:
`./simpletextsplitter filename.txt`
**or**
`./simpletextsplitter`
*if you don't include a filename, it will ask you for one inside the program*
