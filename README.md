# simpletextsplitter
An extremely basic tool for splitting txt files into multiple txt files with a certain amount of characters on each file.

Usage
====
The program can be run on Windows or Linux by dragging a txt file onto the executable.
The prebuilt executables are set to seperate the txt file into 200 characters per file.

You can also run it from a terminal:
` ./simpletextsplitter filename.txt
*or*
` ./simpletextsplitter
*if you don't include a filename, it will ask you for one inside the program*
